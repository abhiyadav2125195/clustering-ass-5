    "A contingency matrix, also known as a confusion matrix, is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It provides a summary of the predicted and actual class labels for a classification task. The matrix has rows representing the true classes and columns representing the predicted classes. Each cell in the matrix represents the number of data points that fall into a specific combination of true class and predicted class. Contingency matrices are used to calculate various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and more, which help assess the model's performance."

    " A pair confusion matrix is a specialized type of confusion matrix used in certain situations, such as evaluating entity recognition tasks in natural language processing. In a pair confusion matrix, each cell represents the count of pairs of entities (e.g., person names) in the ground truth and predicted results. Pair confusion matrices are useful when the order or alignment of entities matters, and they allow for a more detailed evaluation of entity recognition models, considering both the individual entities and their positions."

    " In the context of natural language processing, an extrinsic measure is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a language model based on its performance in a downstream task or application. Instead of assessing the model in isolation, extrinsic measures focus on how well the model's output contributes to the success of a specific task, such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, or text summarization. Extrinsic measures help determine the practical utility of a language model in real-world applications."
